Repo for the R code in "Quantifying the efficacy of taxation on antibiotics to control antimicrobial resistance in food animals using mathematical modelling". 

Code is separated based on the different sections of the study. 

1) Baseline Trajectory Plots (`Baseline`)

2) Distribution Analysis for the Uncertainty Analysis ('Distribution_Analysis')

3) ABC-SMC Model Fit ('Model_Fit')

4) Code for Running R code in Euler using Montecarlo sampling of parameter space ('Euler_Run') 

5) Extra analysis for code checking and hypothesis testing unrelated to the manuscript ('Extra_Anal')

6) Code for the revenue analysis and relevant data ('Money_Analysis')

7) Figures for the final manuscript ('Figures'),
