# Baseline Trajectory Plots 

This folder represents baseline analysis with trajectory plots under different intervention strategies. 

1) Analyses for running two antibiotic classes (`MDR_baseline_two`)

2) Analyses for running four antibiotic classes (`MDR_baseline_four`)

3) Baseline analysis for three antibiotic classes (`Interpol_baseline`)

4) Supplementary analysis assessing the change in average antibiotic usage and antibiotic resistance over time (`Exploring_Usage_AvgRes`)

A 'Deprecated' folder is also available which contains previous iterations of model files for posterity.
