# Analysis of Uncertainty Runs 

These .R files represent the generation of the distribution of effect sizes for each of assessed interventions ('CombHeatMap_statcomparison_pres.R'), this was also performed for four ('CombHeatMap_Dist_four.R') and also two antibiotic classes ('CombHeatMap_Dist_new_two.R'). 

These files also include the generation of the overall comparison of the "proportion that each intervention wins" across different scenarios ('Scenario_Anal_Compare_Bans_v1').

An .R file is also needed to present the information from the uncertainty analyses comparing the proportion of times each intervention "wins" and the distribution of absolute values across each intervention for each optimisation criteria ('Scenario_Anal_Compare_Bans_v1'). 

This latter analysis is generated by reading .RDS files from the 'Euler_run/Model_Output' folder. 

A 'Deprecated' folder is also available to archive previous iterations of model files for posterity.
