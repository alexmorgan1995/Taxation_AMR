# Extra Analysis Files

This file represents the extra analysis performed in this project. These results were not necessarily published in the final manuscript. This includes sensitivity analysis of model parameters using eFAST (´Sensitivity_Anal´). Changes to the denominator of the outcome measure, whether this is changing the assumption to an absolute change in denominator rather than a relative one (`ExploringRel_ReducUsage_Res.R`).

There are also a number of analyses to assess if past a certain reduction in antibiotic usage, there is a greater than proportionate effect on resistance (`Threshold_Effect_v1.R`).

There is also a .R file to explore the impact of the interventions on the average resistance and the average antibiotic usage and to visualise this (`Plotting_Reduc.R`).
