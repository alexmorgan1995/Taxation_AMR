# Model Fit 

The baseline model was fitted to ensure heterogeneity across the different antibiotic classes 'ABC_Fit_EULER_new.R'. The ABC-SMC files can be found in the `Model_Fit` folder and can be seperated into files for the analysis of the posterior dsitribution and running the algorithm. The `Model_Output` folder contains the .csv files for 10 generations obtained from the ABC-SMC model run. 

Posterior distributions can be generated from these .csv files using the 'Model_Fit_Posterior_v1.R' file.
